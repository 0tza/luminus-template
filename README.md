# Luminus-Template

A Leiningen template for projects using [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/). 

The template initializes a base Luminus application.

## Requirements

## Usage

Run the following command to create a new Luminus project:
```bash
lein new luminus <your project name>
```
To build as standalone run:

```bash
lein ring uberjar
```
and you'll be able to run the resulting standalone jar as you would with any other executable Java jar:
```bash
java -jar target/myapp-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
